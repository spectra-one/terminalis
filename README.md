# Terminalis

This VS Code extension is to make switching from one terminal to another a breeze.

I created this extension because I was waiting for VS Code to implement tabbed terminals. I stumbled upon [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.terminal-tabs). Which I based the code on a bit.

## Usage

On activation of the extension, you will see an `Add Terminal` button in the status bar. When clicking this, you can enter a name. The name will apear in the status bar as well as in the default terminal selector. Clicking the name will activate the terminal.

Opening a terminal the default way will also add the new terminal to the status bar. Up to 5 terminals will be added to avoid cluttering the status bar.

You can also use the command:
> \> Add Terminal
